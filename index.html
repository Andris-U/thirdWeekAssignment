			<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello! Welcome to this tiny page for the third week assignment, where I have fun mashing together a few elements I like with no regard for proper design. I'm excited to share this with my sister, a Graphic Design student, so she can gleefully complain about the distracting excessiveness of the background and the complete lack of symmetry of the elements presented.</p>
			<br>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is Andris and I enjoy tea, house music, chiptunes, short walks to my local Tesco, drunken political discussions at the pub and cheesy sci-fi/fantasy books. A fantastic recent addition to that list is, of course, coding! It's been a true revelation. At first I thought that such an obscure and esoteric discipline could only be learned in selected environments, its secrets passed down to you by bearded wizards after a rigorous initiation. Discovering that this was not the case and that, indeed, anyone can learn it to a professional level was one of the most exciting discoveries I've made in recent years, and it has given wings to my dream of becoming a professional developer.</p>
